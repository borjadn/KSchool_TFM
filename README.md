My Master's degree final project, consisting of analysing video games dataset on sales, reviews and other general info. The final objective is to make a video games hits predictor using these data.

Below is the link to a Drive folder with every output file our notebooks would produce, as some of them are quite large in size and only some of the final step datasets are stored here:
[Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MJjZaWUMtwQs1NUpF7TqBWZMAKILZcZk?usp=sharing)

[Get RAWG API key](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

**Files are arranged in the same folders as in the repository, so place the files in the same folders.**

The order of execution is:

1). The notebooks in the Scraping folder, in order (they are numbered).
2). The notebooks in the main folder, also in order (also numbered).
3). Run the webapp.
